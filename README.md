## Steganography-Analyzer
This application was written as a part of the master thesis.

## About app:
```
This application can be used to compare images. Using comparing function, gives you results
about the number of different pixels and PSNR (Peak signal-to-noise ratio) which usually 
expressed in terms of the logarithmic decibel scale.
Moreover, the program generates special image where you can see the hidden message.
On the new generated image, decrease transparency means the areas, in which pixels are equal
on the compared images. Red pixels represent areas in which it was hidden implicit message.
```

## Instructions:
```

1) Load Original Image and Target Image. Click Image > Open and select the image that you are interested
2) Click on the button Compare, to get the results of comparison
3) You can Save the new generated image or clear results
```
